# Expo CLI Development Server Crash

This repository demonstrates an issue where the Expo CLI development server intermittently crashes without providing any error messages in the console.  The application continues to run on the connected device, but developers lose the ability to make changes or hot reload.

## Problem Description

The Expo development server unexpectedly terminates without any indication of the cause.  This issue is non-deterministic, meaning it does not occur consistently and is difficult to reproduce reliably.

## Solution

This repository provides a proposed solution to attempt to identify the problem's root cause, though a definitive fix requires additional investigation and possibly Expo CLI updates. One approach is to carefully review project dependencies and environment settings, and upgrading Expo CLI to the latest version.
