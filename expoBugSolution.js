The root cause of these random crashes is often difficult to pinpoint. A systematic approach to debugging is key.  Here are some steps to try:

1. **Check for conflicting packages:** Carefully examine your `package.json` file for any conflicting packages that might cause issues.  Resolving these conflicts might solve the problem.
2. **Upgrade Expo CLI:** Ensure you're using the latest version of Expo CLI.  Run `expo upgrade` to update to the latest stable release. Sometimes, bugs are fixed in newer versions.
3. **Clean and rebuild the project:** Delete the `node_modules` folder and `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json` file. Then, run `yarn install` or `npm install` to reinstall all dependencies from scratch.
4. **Monitor resource usage:** During development, pay close attention to CPU and memory usage.  If resource limits are frequently exceeded, it could indicate a memory leak or a problem in your app code that results in performance issues which lead to crashes.
5. **Simplify the project:** If the issue is difficult to reproduce in a complex project, try to create a minimal reproducible example by creating a smaller app.  If the problem disappears in the minimal example, it suggests that the issue is tied to specific elements of your project. 
6. **Check Expo forums and GitHub:** Search for similar issues in the Expo community forum and the Expo CLI repository on GitHub.  This might provide insights and workarounds from other developers facing the same issues.
